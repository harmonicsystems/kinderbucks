          <p><strong>You're right that it sounds complicated. But the experience is simple:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For customers:</strong> Show card → get discount. That's it. The gamification stuff is optional gravy.</li>
            <li><strong>For businesses:</strong> Hang a poster. When someone shows a card, give them the discount you already decided on. Done.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The complexity is on the system side—building and maintaining the tech. Your side is: card = discount.</p>
          <div class="callout">
            <strong>No smartphone? No problem.</strong> Physical cards work everywhere. The QR codes just add optional features for people who want them.

          </h3>
          <p><strong>You set your own discount.</strong> 5%, 10%, a free cookie with purchase, whatever works for you. There's no minimum.</p>
          <p>But here's the math that matters: a customer who comes weekly at 10% off is worth <strong>more than double</strong> a customer who comes monthly at full price. You're not losing 10%—you're buying a habit.</p>
          <p>And your real competition isn't the shop next door. It's Amazon. Every local purchase you capture is a dollar that was about to leave Kinderhook permanently.</p>
          <div class="the-real-answer">
            <strong>The real question:</strong> Would you trade 10% margin for 3x the visits? Most businesses would take that deal.

            Honest Answer
          </h3>
          <p><strong>This is a legitimate concern, and we take it seriously.</strong></p>
          <p>Here's what's actually tracked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check-ins (if you choose to scan a QR code)</li>
            <li>Badge progress (if you're playing the game)</li>
            <li>Kinderbucks balance (if you use local currency)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Here's what's NOT tracked:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>What you bought</li>
            <li>How much you spent</li>
            <li>Your location (unless you actively scan)</li>
            <li>Anything about you personally beyond what you volunteer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The key differences from corporate surveillance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-in only.</strong> You can use the discount card and never scan a single QR code.</li>
            <li><strong>Village-owned data.</strong> This isn't sold to advertisers. It stays here.</li>
            <li><strong>Radical transparency.</strong> Aggregate data (how many people visited the bakery this week) is shared openly with the community—not hidden in corporate dashboards.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete anytime.</strong> Request it, and your data is gone.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="the-real-answer">
            <strong>Compare to the alternative:</strong> Every time you use a credit card, Google Maps, or shop on Amazon, you're generating far more invasive data that's sold without your knowledge. This system collects less and keeps it local.

            Honest Answer
          </h3>
          <p><strong>Yes. AI tools helped build this.</strong> Claude helped write code, design documents, and think through edge cases.</p>
          <p>You know what else was used? A computer. The internet. A phone. Google Docs.</p>
          <p>AI is a tool. The vision, the commitment, and the accountability are human—from people who live here. We're the ones who will show up to fix things when they break. We're the ones whose reputation is on the line.</p>
          <p>If you wouldn't buy bread from someone who used a stand mixer instead of kneading by hand, then yeah, this program isn't for you. But if you care about results more than process purity, then what matters is: <strong>does this work for Kinderhook?</strong></p>
          <div class="callout">
            <strong>The reality:</strong> Most people building community projects don't have infinite hours. AI lets us build things we couldn't build alone. We'd rather ship something useful than gatekeep tools.

            Honest Answer
          </h3>
          <p><strong>Healthy skepticism is fair. Here's why this is worth the risk:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally owned and operated.</strong> This is built by Kinderhook residents who aren't going anywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>No one's taking money.</strong> This is volunteer-built in exchange for helping the village thrive.</li>
            <li><strong>The code is open source.</strong> Anyone can see exactly what it does. There's no black box.</li>
            <li><strong>The data stays local.</strong> Nothing is sold to anyone. There's no business model that depends on exploiting this.</li>
            <li><strong>You can verify.</strong> The organizers are known community members. Ask around.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="the-real-answer">
            <strong>The real question isn't "are these people trustworthy?"</strong> It's "what's the worst case if they aren't?" The answer: some QR codes stop working and a small amount of anonymized visit data exists. That's... not much of a scam.

          </h3>
          <p><strong>Fair question. Here's the plan:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open source code.</strong> Everything is on GitHub. Any developer can pick it up.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation.</strong> How-to guides are written as we build, not after.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple technology.</strong> This runs on standard tools (Firebase, React). It's not proprietary magic.</li>
            <li><strong>Graceful degradation.</strong> If the digital stuff dies, the physical cards still work as "show this for a discount." Kinderbucks are just paper money. The system doesn't require any single person to function.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The "hit by a bus" scenario is real for any project with a small team—and the answer is documentation, open source, and simple design. We're doing all three.</p>

            Honest Answer
          </h3>
          <p><strong>Most local programs fail for three reasons:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>They cost money to run.</strong> This one doesn't. Tech is free. Labor is volunteer.</li>
            <li><strong>They require coordination.</strong> This one doesn't. Each business participates independently.</li>
            <li><strong>They're boring.</strong> This one has game mechanics that make participation sticky.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But you're right that most fail. And this one might too. The difference is the cost of trying is nearly zero. ~$1,500 to print some Kinderbucks and cards. Volunteer time to build the app. A few posters in windows.</p>
          <p>If it doesn't work, we've lost almost nothing. If it does work, we've built something valuable.</p>
          <div class="the-real-answer">
            <strong>Also:</strong> BerkShares has been running since 2006 with 400+ participating businesses and $8 million in circulation. It's not impossible. It just requires the right conditions—and a village this size, with this much local pride, might actually have them.
